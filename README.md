This repository contains the term project completed for the **PH3203: Advanced Quantum Mechanics** course (6th semester) at **IISER Kolkata**.

The project presents a theoretical study of the **Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser** experiment. It includes:
- A detailed review of the physical concepts involved, such as complementarity, entanglement, and delayed choice.
- A step-by-step derivation of the two-photon entangled state produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).
- Analytical calculations of coincidence detection rates for different detector configurations.
- Explanation of how interference patterns emerge or disappear depending on the availability of which-path information.
- Discussion of the experimental observations reported in the original quantum eraser experiments.

The repository primarily serves as a record of the theoretical analysis and derivations carried out as part of the course term project.
